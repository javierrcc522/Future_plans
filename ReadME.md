## Projects Goals
_The goal of this is to keep me motivated once i'm done with Epicodus and list out all of the items I want to keep improving on, and finish all courses I bought in Udemy_

## This are some of my Post-Epicodus plans

* _1. Finish "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts." I have only completed 8% of the video course. I met Andrew Brennwald a Tree House teacher at a meet up and he highly recommended me to do this course_

* _2. Finish "Learning Algorithms in JavaScript from Scratch." I have only completed 19% of this course. My skills with Algorithms wasn't great, but ever since I started this course I was able to connect the dots and felt more confident ever since_

* _3. Complete "Node.js Developer Course." this is another course I bought and I never finish. I have only completed 7%. I already know the basics of this framework but I want to know a bit more_

* _4. Complete all the exercises of "Modern React with Redux." with this course I hope to understand the so called "functional" programming_

* _5. So far, I've completed 19% of this course but I want to fortify my understanding of Ruby by completing "Learn to Code with Ruby" this is another course I bought while I was learning ruby_

* _6. I really want to learn Python because I could actually develop and play with SC2 deep mind environment "Starcraft 2 my favorite game." I bought another Udemy course "Complete Python Bootcamp GO from zero to hero in python", they go from the basics to fully create my own applications and game!!!_
