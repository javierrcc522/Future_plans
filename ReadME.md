# _Future plans Site 12.15.2017_

#### By _**Javier Jim√©nez**_

## Projects Goals :octocat:
_The goal of this is to keep me motivated once i'm done with Epicodus and list out all of the items I want to keep improving on, and finish all courses I bought in Udemy. Each one of them has a priority level._

## This are some of my Post-Epicodus plans

* _1. Finish JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts I have only completed 8% of the video course. I met Andrew Brennwald a Tree House teacher at a meet up and he highly recommended me to do this course._ [JS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/learn/v4/overview) _Priority level:_ :six:


* _2. Do an Algorithm a day with the help of this website._ [Python tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)_. Code wars doesn't really let you choose what Algorithm you get to work in, that's why I chose it_ [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/javierjjm522) _Priority level:_ :seven:

* _3. Finish "Learning Algorithms in JavaScript from Scratch." I have only completed 19% of this course. My skills with Algorithms wasn't great, but ever since I started this course I was able to connect the dots and felt more confident ever since._ [Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/learning-algorithms-in-javascript-from-scratch/learn/v4/content) _Priority level:_ :one::zero:

* _4. Complete "Node.js Developer Course." this is another course I bought and I never finish. I have only completed 7%. I already know the basics of this framework but I want to know a bit more._ [Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/content) _Priority level:_ :four:

* _5. Complete all the exercises of "Modern React with Redux." with this course I hope to understand the so called "functional" programming._ [React](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content) _Priority level:_ :seven:

* _6. So far, I've completed 19% of this course but I want to fortify my understanding of Ruby by completing "Learn to Code with Ruby" this is another course I bought while I was learning ruby._ [Ruby](https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/learn/v4/content) _Priority level:_ :three:

* _7. I really want to learn Python because I could actually develop and play with SC2 deep mind environment(machine learning). Starcraft 2 is my favorite game by the way. I bought another Udemy course "Complete Python Bootcamp GO from zero to hero in python", they go from the basics to fully create my own applications and game!!!_ [Python](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/content) _Priority level:_ :five:

* _8. The last course I bought and I want to finish at my own pace is GO lang. Reasons? Well, GO is as efficient as Java, C, and C++ but the language is beautiful, straight forward and concurrent, and it's the future lol._ [Go](https://www.udemy.com/go-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/content) _Priority level:_ :six:

* _9. Keep advancing on FreeCodeCamp, I want to finish all their fronted and backend. Right now I am at 227 lessons completed almost done with the front-end certificate. I want to bring this number to at least 400._ [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/javierrcc522) _Priority level:_ :seven:

* _10. I want to add aesthetics to my Rails Portfolio Site and deploy it to Heroku, maybe some ajax._ _Priority level:_ :six:

* _11. Attend Epicodus alumni meet ups, and actually talk to them and not just go get free pizza haha._ _Priority level:_ :four:

* _12. Learn D3.js to show data in my websites._
[Stock](http://arnauddri.github.io/d3-stock/), [Global Data](http://bl.ocks.org/dwtkns/4973620) _Priority level:_ :six:

* _13. Bring my typing skills to 60 wpm in this website._ [Typing](https://www.typing.com) _Priority level:_ :three:

* _14. Practice personal interview questions such as: talking about myself, being more direct and give explanation after they ask a question, and better wording, even write them down on paper._ _Priority level:_ :eight:

* _15. Writing test to my future projects so I can get used to what the real world programming development is like._ _Priority level:_ :seven:

* _16. Make a StackOverFlow account. Answer and ask questions there, also be descriptive._ _Priority level:_ :two:

* _17. Work on open source projects at least 1 every 2 months._ [Open/Source](https://github.com/search?q=label:hacktoberfest+state:open+type:issue) _Priority level:_ :four:

* _18. Get really familiar with atom and its shortcuts basically not touch the mouse as much. I installed a packaged for atom that has all the shortcuts._ [Shortcuts](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts) _Priority level:_ :six:

* _19. First buy the book, read the book, and take notes._ [Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330) _Priority level:_ :five:

* _20. Seek a mentor. This one is a bit tough because it takes 2 parties to make this happened. I tried in the past but no one really follow thru, All I can say is that I can also be my own mentor._ _Priority level:_ :eight:



## Summarize
_Before the internship, while we are in christmas break, I will try to scratch off some of this objectives in this list to keep my skill set sharp._
_During my internship, I will still keep looking at this list try to see what I need to work on. I will be looking and applying for jobs._
_After the internship, if i haven't gotten a job, I shall work on this list and better myself to become more appealing to recruiters._
