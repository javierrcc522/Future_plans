## Projects Goals :octocat:
_The goal of this is to keep me motivated once i'm done with Epicodus and list out all of the items I want to keep improving on, and finish all courses I bought in Udemy_

## This are some of my Post-Epicodus plans

* _1. Finish JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts I have only completed 8% of the video course. I met Andrew Brennwald a Tree House teacher at a meet up and he highly recommended me to do this course._ [JS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/learn/v4/overview)


* _2. Finish "Learning Algorithms in JavaScript from Scratch." I have only completed 19% of this course. My skills with Algorithms wasn't great, but ever since I started this course I was able to connect the dots and felt more confident ever since._ [Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/learning-algorithms-in-javascript-from-scratch/learn/v4/content)

* _3. Complete "Node.js Developer Course." this is another course I bought and I never finish. I have only completed 7%. I already know the basics of this framework but I want to know a bit more._ [Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/content)

* _4. Complete all the exercises of "Modern React with Redux." with this course I hope to understand the so called "functional" programming._ [React](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content)

* _5. So far, I've completed 19% of this course but I want to fortify my understanding of Ruby by completing "Learn to Code with Ruby" this is another course I bought while I was learning ruby._ [Ruby](https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/learn/v4/content)

* _6. I really want to learn Python because I could actually develop and play with SC2 deep mind environment(machine learning). Starcraft 2 is my favorite game by the way. I bought another Udemy course "Complete Python Bootcamp GO from zero to hero in python", they go from the basics to fully create my own applications and game!!!_ [Python](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/content)

* _7. The last course I bought and I want to finish at my own pace is GO lang. Reasons? Well, GO is as efficient as Java, C, and C++ but the language is beautiful, straight forward and concurrent, and it's the future lol._ [Go](https://www.udemy.com/go-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/content)
